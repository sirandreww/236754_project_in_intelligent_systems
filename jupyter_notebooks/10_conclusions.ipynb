    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lessons alongst the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Youtube tutorials and blogs cheat, we have yet to find an lstm implementation which does not use the true values to predict further than one sample into the future. It's so common that in fact that we felt like we might have missed something. But then we found a video that talks about just that, for more information watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t9hKclQNH4&ab_channel=LazyProgrammer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One step forcasting (forcasting one step into the future) is surprisingly effective. We started with the notion that it cannot work, since the errors would accumulate over time and would result in bad predictions. But they actually work quite well in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is hard to quantify how good a prediction is, some prediction look very close but end up getting a bad f1 or a bad MASE. Some look totally off but get good grades in either F1 or MASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Percision - Out of all true predictions, what percentage of which are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recall - Out of all the truely positive value, what percentage of which did you get right by identifying that they are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. F1 - This metric is between one and zero, it is essentially a harmonic mean of the precision and recall. For time series forcasting positive and negative relate to if the graph is rising or falling between each two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MAE - Mean Absolute Error, like MSE except absolute instead of square.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. MASE - The MAE of a prediction devided by the MAE of the naieve prediction, which is to simply predict the value of the previous sample.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From these results we can talk about some interesting points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DumbPredictor shows up, even though this is not a real predictor, the reason being that it shows up in apps that don't have a lot of data, so the Neural networks don't have enough to learn off of. Furthermore, all these models have a forcast horizon of 1 which means that the error of the prediction compounds the longer the prediction is.\n",
    "2. DeepAr shows up the most, which corresponds with the expectation that it's a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time series forcasting is hard, one must be very careful when building models, a lot of patience is required.\n",
    "2. Hyper parameter tuning is still needed. For example TFT is said to be the cutting edge of time series forcasting, yet we didn't see much of it in our case.\n",
    "3. Metrics aren't everything, in some cases we noticed that some models were getting good metric grades although they were not caputring the real shape of the prediction. These models were essentially averaging the graph in some manner to get good metric scores. On the other hand, some prediction algorithms were very close to the real shape of the prediction, but were off by a some shift which resulted in bad F1 and MASE scores.\n",
